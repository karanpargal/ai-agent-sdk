Each LLM is an adapter around a language model provider and the specific model version, eg: `gpt-4o-mini`. Each [Agent](./agents) can pick their own model and a [ZeeWorkflow](./zeeworkflows) can be configured to use a specific LLM as default.

```tsx
const llm = new LLM({
    provider: "OPEN_AI",
    name: "gpt-4o-mini",
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
    temperature: 0.7
});
```

## Use Cases

### Image Analysis

LLMs can also process images along with text using image URL messages. Here's an example of analyzing an image using the LLM:

```typescript
const messages = [
    {
        role: "user",
        content: [
            {
                type: "text",
                text: "What's in this image? Analyze the logo and suggest improvements.",
            },
            {
                type: "image_url",
                image_url: {
                    url: "https://example.com/logo.png",
                    detail: "auto",
                },
            },
        ],
    },
];

const schema = {
    analysis: z.object({
        description: z.string(),
        colors: z.array(z.string()),
        text_content: z.string().optional(),
        improvements: z.string().optional(),
    }),
};

const result = await llm.generate(messages, schema, {});
```

The LLM will analyze the image and return a structured response containing the description, colors used, and potential improvements. You can also use base64-encoded images by providing the data URL:

```typescript
const messages = [
    {
        role: "user",
        content: [
            {
                type: "text",
                text: "What's in this image and what color is it?",
            },
            {
                type: "image_url",
                image_url: {
                    url: "data:image/png;base64,..." // Your base64 image data
                    detail: "auto",
                },
            },
        ],
    },
];
```

Note: Image analysis is currently supported by OpenAI models. Some providers like Gemini may have limited or no support for image analysis.
